-- Assistance Requests Data
-- Each assistance request is related to a bunch of data like a teacher, student, assignment, and more. We want to be able to see all important data about an assistance request.

-- Get important data about each assistance request.

-- Select the teacher's name, student's name, assignment's name, and the duration of each assistance request.
-- Subtract completed_at by started_at to find the duration.
-- Order by the duration of the request.



SELECT teachers.name as teacher, students.name as student, assignments.name as assignment, (completed_at-started_at) as duration
FROM assistance_requests
JOIN teachers ON teachers.id = teacher_id
JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
JOIN assignments ON assignments.id = assignment_id
