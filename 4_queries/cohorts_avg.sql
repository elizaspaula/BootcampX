-- Cohort Average Assistance Duration

-- We also need to know the average total amount of time being spent on an assistance request for each cohort. This is just the average of the total_duration column from the previous query.

-- Calculate the average total duration of assistance requests for each cohort.

-- Use the previous query as a sub query to determine the duration per cohort.
-- Return a single row average_total_duration

SELECT avg (total_duration) as average_total_duration
FROM (
  SELECT cohorts.name as cohort, sum(completed_at-started_at) as total_duration
  FROM assistance_requests
  JOIN students ON students.id = student_id
  JOIN cohorts on cohorts.id = cohort_id
  GROUP BY cohorts.name
  ORDER BY total_duration
) as total_durations;
